# JBoss BPMS on IBM WebSphere 8.5

Red Hat's JBoss BPM Suite provides you the choice of Java EE or Web container to run on, choice of Spring, JEE, or pure Java, and the option to deploy as a service or embedded as a framework into your application.  This projects provides an environment you can get up and running quickly with JBoss BPM Suite on IBM WebSphere 8.5 with Oracle as a backing database. It will provide a sample embedded Spring+JBPM+Oracle application using the high level features of the engine as well.

## Prerequistites

Before you can build and run this set of docker images you need to download the IBM installation manager and the three part install of WebSphere Application Server 8.5 for Developers.  

#### A) Register for IBM developer program

IBM allows for free download of WebSphere application server if you [register on their site](https://www.ibm.com/account/profile/us?page=reg).

#### B) Download IBM Installation Manager and WebSphere

Go to the [IBM WebSphere download page](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/), click Download, select the HTTP / Download Director option, and then continue.  

First, download the Installation Manager for Linux x86_64. Note that you may be running this on another operating system, however the base docker image will be 64bit centos - so make sure you select the right file.  Move the file and rename it to `fsi-bpm-refarch/docker-ibm-im/agent.installer.linux.gtk.x86_64.zip` 

```
Installation Manager for Linux x86_64 with WebSphere Application Server for Developers including Liberty, v8.5.5
DEVELOPERSILAN.agent.installer.linux.gtk.x86_64.zip  (158M)   
```

Next, download the three part WebSphere Application Server install.  

Move and rename the following to `fsi-bpm-refarch/docker-ibm-was/was_part1.zip`
```
IBM WebSphere Application Server for Developers, Full Profile (Part 1 of 3)
was.repo.8550.developers.ilan_part1.zip  (1.1G) 
```

Move and rename the following to `fsi-bpm-refarch/docker-ibm-was/was_part2.zip`
```
IBM WebSphere Application Server for Developers, Full Profile (Part 2 of 3)
was.repo.8550.developers.ilan_part2.zip  (1.1G) 
```

Move and rename the following to `fsi-bpm-refarch/docker-ibm-was/was_part3.zip`
```
IBM WebSphere Application Server for Developers, Full Profile (Part 3 of 3)
was.repo.8550.developers.ilan_part3.zip  (903M) 
```

#### C) Install and Start docker

[Install and Start docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and test that docker commands such as `docker ps` works.

#### D) Install Maven

[Install maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and make sure that the `mvn` command is on the system bin path on the host system.


## Building the Reference Architecture

The following script will both build the JBPM+Spring application, and build the docker images. 
``` 
./docker-build.sh
```

## Starting and Stopping the Reference Architecture

The following script reset the, or start, the Oracle XE database and BPMS Service on WAS docker instances.
``` 
./docker-start.sh
```
